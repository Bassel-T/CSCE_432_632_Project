# CSCE 432/632 Project

## Overview

This application was created for Texas A&M University, CSCE 432-500 and CSCE 632-600 in Spring 2025. The application aims to create an environment through which people can remind their loved ones—targeted at people with
dementia—to perform their daily tasks. We allow users to enter groups as a sender or a receiver, then allow senders to record and send videos to a receiver. The goal is to make the interface as simple as possible so the
application remains easy to use by everyone. This assists those with dementia, who often have memory troubles and difficulty learning new technologies.

## Requirements

This application runs the MAUI frontend with an ASP.NET Core backend. Thus, the following are required:
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 8.0
- SQL Server
- Rancher Desktop
- Android Studio (for Android deployment)

## Development

To develop for this application, open two instances of Visual Studio 2022: One for the frontend and one for the backend.

## Branching

To maintain organization, create a new branch for each feature or bug fix in a folder under your name. Create a PR going into the `main` branch when ready for review. When the merge has been completed, delete the source branch.

## Deployment

TODO
